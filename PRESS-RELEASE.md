## Problem ##
  > There is no fullstack ReactJS Generator. Existing react generators offer few features/options. React is gaining popularity and this issue needs to be addressed.

## Solution ##
  > Elegantly drafts scaffolds for faster implementation of React applications. Drastically reduces the learning curve and time spent writing boilerplate code. Integrates perfectly with Flux and has a complete backend using Express and Mongo.
